# Data Structures and Algorithms I - Linked Lists

This is the starter code for Computer Science - Sprint 2: Data Structures and Algorithms I - Module 2: Linked Lists.

Please fork and clone this repo to your computer by the start of class.
Link lists 

they usually have these :
get/ access 
insert (insert is 0(1))
delete 
search (traversal)
